# spotify-listening-rooms

React front-end consumes a Django RESTful API backend.

This project integrates with Spotify's 3rd-party API.

Users are allowed to host rooms, and other users can join these rooms with a unique room code.

The host of the room is able to control the song that is playing on all room members' Spotify player.

Host a listening party with your friends, and everyone's Spotify player will be synched!
